If you've recently survived a layoff in 2023, don't worry, you're not safe just yet. However, here are some tips on how to be prepared for the possibility of one in the future.

I've always practiced the habit of keeping one eye open for other opportunities, even if I didn't necessarily intend to switch jobs. My first tip is to always engage in interviews, just to stay in touch with the job market. This practice has taught me over the years to have a better sense of what I need to prepare and how to present myself. Even if you don't succeed in all of them (like me), it's good to get some practice in.

### Piggy Bank
Save up some cash in the bank. It's always easier to think and decide on a path forward after a layoff when you're not hungry or have bills piling up.

### Work for Free
This one is a bit controversial, but I think it makes a valid point. Be willing to work for free. This doesn't mean undervaluing yourself, but rather demonstrating your passion for what you do. If you love what you do, you'll likely produce outstanding results, which in turn improves your chances of finding your next job.

### Plan It Out
Create a plan and set some goals to describe what you're looking for next. Set a date for when you'll execute or begin your job search.

### LinkedIn
Post on LinkedIn that you're open to new opportunities. I'm not entirely sure about this one, as it might attract a wide range of opportunities. However, it's worth a shot if you don't have something more precise or specific in mind.

### Just In Case
Have a backup profession in mind. While I don't have one yet, I do have some ideas of what would be plausible for me. It's essential not to have all your eggs in the same basket.

### Bonus
(Extra Points) If possible, have a supportive spouse who can provide financial assistance for a while. This can be immensely helpful during a period of transition.
