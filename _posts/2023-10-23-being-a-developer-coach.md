title: Being a developer Coach, what I learned in 2 years.
categories: [management,coach,en]
---

When this role was entrusted to me, I wasn't expecting it at all. Previously, I mostly did development work and some mentoring for junior and new employees who were starting at our company. 

In essence, it was new territory for me, and I had to find my own way into it and improve my people skills so that I could help the people in my own coaching team.

### How it happened
So Initially how this worked is that we had a restructuuring in the company, and new roles were introduced, where we had to paths on which we could develop, as engineers and as managers. 

In between we had a new special role that was called a "Coach", we didn't get much context at first what this new role means, but anyway I was awarded with the Coach role on our all hands meeting (to my surprise). 

It was overwhelming at first, to somehow fit in the new obligations to my new Coachees, as I was now responsible for their professional and personal development, and also responsible for their performance. Some questions popped up in my mind, imposter sindrome shining through most of them. How do I qualify to help another person with his carrier when I often don't know where I am going.

But as with any new skill I had to dive deep and figre it out, find resournces to learn from, talk to other Coaches to get some insight into how they approached their coaching teams. 

## The why 
The reason for introducing this kind of managerial role for a company, from my understand is to have better visibility into a growing organization, where each employee in the company has a dedicated "Coach" they basically report to, while the Coaches report to the company top management, its esentially an Engineering Manager type role, with  more focus on helping developers be and achieve their best. 

## âœ· Here are some processes and methods I used

### âœ§ 1n1 meeting with each
One of the first decisions I made to make a start on this new role, was to organize 1 to 1 meetings and get aquainted with each of my team members, even though some Coaches did the first meeting with all their coachees present, that style didn't really work for my personallity as I like to be able to focus on the person to get to know them, I also didn't yet have a proven way to get things going, so 1n1 style better suited also my situation as I could be flexible and change my approach based on a team members specific needs. 

### âœ§ Schedule regular checkups/syncs
After getting to know each person in my team, my seccond decision was to schedule a monthly meeting/check up with them. The goal of this was to be able to get a sense of how they are doing on a particular project they are working on, and if they have any problems we can discuss. 

### âœ§ Have notes
Next important point I realized is that its hard to keep track of the discussions and remember the things we talked about and decided on as action items, so ideally its best to have a shared document with each coachee where you outline meeting goals and decisions or action items, so its much easier to stay accountable. 

### âœ§ Listen first 
The whole point of coaching developers, is to be able to understand where they are right now so that you can push them forward, and you can only find that out by listening and asking the proper questions. 

- What lifted you up in the past month, and what weighted you down? 
- What do you feel is an area where you're laking atm. and would like to improve? 
- If we had a scale from 1 to 7 where would you put yourself in relation to a skill you would like to develop? 
- How can I support you?
- Do you have any problems in your team? (more specific)
- Do you feel like you can raise any concerns to your team or manager? (more specific)


### âœ§ Set goals 
Its hard to move forward and know that you made progress unless you have set goals and ways to mesure them, so after a year in my coachin team, I tried to help my coachees set their goals for the next period. 
Initially we tried setting the goals for the whole year, but it proved to be hard to fullfil most of the goals because of the time constraints, so we trimmed down the goals to be only next 6 months and achiavable from the coachee perspective. 

### âœ§ Be available 
In order for coaches to trust me and share their concerns and problems I think its key to just be available, my approach was always to get on a call, and often pair programm and have the person describe the problem, where I act as an observer and ask questions, its an indespensible tool when doing any kind of mentoring in software development. 

### âœ§ Find motivation, switch things up
One of the things that I struggled with even though my coachees were doing fine on all fronts is just to find motivation and the why, cause you don't really know how much you're actually making a difference in the persons carrier. 
We can often get stuck in the regular schedule/agenda, and finding new areas to explore in our sessions is not easy. 
So my approach there was to ask and get a feel on how we're doing, and if they feel like they have got some real benefit from the discussions. Also another idea is to just ask the coachee on what they would like to talk about. 



In the above article I tried to mostly draw from my own experiences as a manager for a number of developers, you can draw any concluisions from it, but I do hope its helpfull to anyone starting a similar jurney.
