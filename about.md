Hi, my name is Dušan Petković, I am a Software Enginier from Niš, Serbia. My primary focus is creating customized solutions based on ReactJs and Node using the latest in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

After getting a Bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design, I’ve spent the first few years of my career working as a graphic designer, developing concepts, mockups, and artwork for websites, and print designs for a wide range of publications advertisements.

Soon after, I started to diversify my skillset and got into coding. I got involved in web development projects and started learning fast. My minimalistic approach and attention to detail come from my design background.

## About The Blog
I started this blog so that I can have a place to share and write about my experiences, and give back to the community by sharing some good tips and tutorials.

## Philosophy
My general rule is that I always try to focus on one thing at a time, that way I am at my maximum productivity. Also searching for any new and better solutions that might help me improve my work process and resulting implementations.

## Life Outside
When I am not arching in front of the screen, I unwind and relieve stress by training hard, lifting weights, swimming, and other fun stuff. On the weekends I usually escape to the countryside to enjoy some fresh air and sunny weather, it is the best thing, start Mondays feeling refreshed and ready for new challenges.
