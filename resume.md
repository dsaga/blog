I am a results-driven front-end web developer with extensive experience building customized solutions utilizing React, TypeScript, JavaScript, SCSS, ES6, and Node.js. I have experience leading small teams of developers, writing project specifications, and communicating directly with clients.

I am motivated to constantly improve my skills and provide value to clients by working on the cutting edge with a focus on the front-end while maintaining full-stack awareness and ability.
